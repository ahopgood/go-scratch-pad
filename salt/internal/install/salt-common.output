 Description: shared libraries that salt requires for all packages
  salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
  administer servers in a fast and efficient way.
  .
  It allows commands to be executed across large groups of
  servers. This means systems can be easily managed, but data can
  also be easily gathered.  Quick introspection into running
  systems becomes a reality.
  .
  Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a
  remote system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt
  state system uses salt state files to define the state a server
  needs to be in.
  .
  Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt
  addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.
  .
  This particular package provides shared libraries that
  salt-master, salt-minion, and salt-syndic require to function.
