 Description: Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts
  AGL (Adobe Glyph List) maps glyph names to Unicode values for the
  purpose of deriving content. AGLFN (Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts) is a
  subset of AGL that excludes the glyph names associated with the PUA
  (Private Use Area), and is meant to specify preferred glyph names for
  new fonts. Also included is the ITC Zapf Dingbats Glyph List, which is
  similar to AGL in that it maps glyph names to Unicode values for the
  purpose of deriving content, but only for the glyphs in the ITC Zapf
  Dingbats font.
  .
  Be sure to visit the AGL Specification and Developer Documentation pages
  for detailed information about naming glyphs, interpreting glyph names,
  and developing OpenType fonts.
