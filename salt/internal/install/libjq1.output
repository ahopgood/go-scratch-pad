 Description: lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor - shared library
  jq is like sed for JSON data – you can use it to slice
  and filter and map and transform structured data with
  the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you
  play with text.
  .
  It is written in portable C, and it has minimal runtime
  dependencies.
  .
  jq can mangle the data format that you have into the
  one that you want with very little effort, and the
  program to do so is often shorter and simpler than
  you’d expect.
  .
  This package contains the shared library.
